Joining lines :  M-^

Multiple Cursors combined with M-^ will collapse all selected
lines into one with all extraneous white-space removed.

For example to select an entire buffer, invoke multiple cursors
mode, collapse into one line, and then disable multiple cursors mode:

C-x h
M-x mc/edit-lines
M-^
C-g
